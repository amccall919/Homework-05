# Homework-5

## Module 5 Homework

I really enjoyed this assignment as I was able to code and enter data from CSV files and use for real time analysis. I especially liked seeing the graphs that were created from the script written from the data. I think this will come in very handy in the future.

I feel like I am getting more comfortable and confident in my file usage as well as the scripting of the python code to pull and use various sources of information. I especially love the Jupyter Notebook. It is a complete game changer for checking code before programming a lot and then finding out at the end it doesn't work. 

My analysis of the data can be found at the top of my code. I have also placed it here.

### Analysis

Observation #1: There were more male mice used than femail mice used. 
Observation #2: The tumor volume decreased the longer the Capomulin treatment was given. 
Observation #3: With the linear regression line trending upward along with weight, we can conclude that there is a positive correlation between the mouse weight and the volume of the tumor.
